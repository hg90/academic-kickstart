# Biography

I am currently a fourth year PhD student studying Statistics and Operations Research at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is my great privilege to have [Prof. Chuanshu Ji](http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/ji.html) supervising my doctoral reserach. 
 
 My research interests are broadly in the areas of using Bayesian approach to solve problems on dynamic models such as stochastic differential equations and Markov-based models. My current research focuses on Bayesian inference on stochastic cusp differential equations. 

 Before joing UNC, I received MS in Mathematics from [Courant Institute, NYU](https://cims.nyu.edu/) and BS in Applied Mathematics from UNC - Chapel Hill. I also received high school diploma from [Jinan Foreigh Language School](https://www.jnfls.com) in China. My resume is {{% staticref "files/resume.pdf" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

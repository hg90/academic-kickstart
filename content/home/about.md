# Biography

I am currently a fourth year PhD student studying [Statistics and Operations Research](https://stat-or.unc.edu/) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is my great privilege to have [Prof. Chuanshu Ji](http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/ji.html) as my advisor supervising my doctoral work and research. 
 
 My research interests lie primarily in the areas of using Bayesian approach to solve inference problems on dynamic models such as stochastic differential equations and Markov-based models. My current research focuses on Bayesian inference on stochastic cusp differential equations. 

 Prior to joining the PhD program in UNC, I studied at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences NYU](https://cims.nyu.edu/) where I received MS in Mathematics. I attended UNC Chapel Hill for my undergraduate study where I received BS in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Mathematical Decision Science. I also received high school diploma from [Jinan Foreign Language School](https://www.jnfls.com) in China. My resume is {{% staticref "files/resume.pdf" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

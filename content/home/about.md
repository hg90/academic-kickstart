# Biography

I am currently a PhD student studying Statistics and Operations Research at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I joined the PhD program in Interdisciplinary Statistic and Operations Research ([INSTORE](https://stat-or.unc.edu/programs/interdisciplinary-statistics-and-operations-research-instore/ph-d-program-in-instore)) under Department of Statistics and Operations Research at UNC in Fall 2015. It is my great privilege to have [Prof. Chuanshu Ji](http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/ji.html) as my advisor supervising my doctoral work and research. 
 
 My research interests lie primarily in the areas of using Bayesian approach (Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to solve statistical inference problem of dynamic models such as stochastic differential equations and Markov-based models. My current research focuses on Bayesian inference on stochastic cusp differential equations. 

 Prior to joining the PhD program in UNC, I studied at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU](https://cims.nyu.edu/) where I received MS in Mathematics. I attended UNC Chapel Hill for my undergraduate study where I received BS in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Mathematical Decision Science. I received high school diploma from [Jinan Foreign Language School](https://www.jnfls.com) in China. My resume is {{% staticref "files/resume.pdf" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.
